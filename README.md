## Acknowledgment

This project is based on ([code](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing)), Swin-Transformer ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030.pdf), [code](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer)), thanks for their excellent works.

* **We release [Fast-iTPN](https://github.com/sunsmarterjie/iTPN/tree/main/fast_itpn) recently, which reports the best performance on ImageNet-1K at Tiny/Small/Base level models as far as we know. (Tiny-24M-86.5%, Small-40M-87.8%, Base-85M-88.75%)**
