# Ultra-Multi-SWIN

### Initial Commit Message

This is the initial version of the codebase. Please note that this release is a raw version, and we are currently in the process of refining and organizing the code. We will be releasing a standardized version shortly, which will include improved documentation, better code organization, and enhanced readability. Stay tuned for updates!


## Acknowledgment

This project is based on ([code](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing)), Swin-Transformer ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030.pdf), [code](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer)), thanks for their excellent works.

* **We release [Ultra-Multi-SWIN](https://github.com/Tian-CN/Ultra-Multi-SWIN) (model, train, pth) recently, which reports the best performance on PE-US dataset as far as we know. (Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement over baselines for subject-dependent experiments (ACC: 0.988, STD: 0.019), subject-independent experiments (ACC: 0.952, STD: 0.073), and other open-access medical datasets.)**
